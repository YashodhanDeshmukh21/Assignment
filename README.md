# Stock Volatility Calculator

This Python script calculates the daily and annualized volatility of stock data from a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the `pandas` and `numpy` libraries. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy
CSV File Format
Your CSV file should meet the following criteria:
```

##The file must be in CSV format.
1.Column headers should not contain any spaces. If they do, replace the spaces with underscores or remove them.
2.The CSV file should contain the following headers at a minimum:
  Date
  Close


If your CSV headers contain spaces, you can use the following Python snippet to clean the headers:

import pandas as pd

def clean_csv_headers(file_path):
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    df.columns = df.columns.str.replace(' ', '_')
    df.to_csv(file_path, index=False)

clean_csv_headers('path_to_your_file.csv')
Replace 'path_to_your_file.csv' with the path to your actual CSV file.

##Usage
To calculate volatility, run the script volatility_calculator.py with the path to your CSV file as an argument:

##bash
python volatility_calculator.py path_to_your_file.csv

##Output
The script will output:

Daily Volatility: Standard deviation of the daily returns.
Annualized Volatility: Daily Volatility multiplied by the square root of the number of data entries.
